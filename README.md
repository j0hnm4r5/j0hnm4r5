### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm John Mars**,
a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Shield AI, and a [Creative Technologist](https://github.com/j0hnm4r5/awesome-creative-technology) who bridges the gap between the worlds of design and engineering.

Iâ€™ve built [a portal to another dimension](https://hellomars.dev/projects/rickflector), told stories using [motion-tracking and VR](https://hellomars.dev/projects/cloud-space), and I even have a [patent for mixed-reality haptics](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10431006B2/).

Clients I've worked with include Disney, Google, Adult Swim, Netflix, TikTok, Virgin Voyages, T-Mobile, Flutter, Android, and Lyft.

I use tools like React, Node.js, Three.js, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Unity, TouchDesigner, Max/MSP, and 3D printers.
